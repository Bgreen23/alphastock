        <p class="info">
        I decided to take the highest weekly price of five stocks from the month of September of 2018. September has shown an overall stable trend with no company taking a dive for better or worse.

        <p class="info">
           The second visualization shows the lowest weekly prices of September. This visualization is very similar to the fist, however there are a few slight differences. Nvidia(dark green) and Apple(purple) have shown a drop in their overall low price. This is something to keep an eye on for short term stock trades because it shows that these two companies carry a higher investment risk.

        <p class="info">
          Based on the weekly stock information, Nvidia seems to be the best option. It carries the highest risk/reward but you stand to gain more money in the short term than lose. If needed, I can make another visualization that shows long term stock potential but for now I have decided to give you the information you need to make the best decisions for a quick turnaround.
